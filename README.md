# CDR Analysis with Insights

This project provides an analytical dashboard for **Call Detail Record (CDR)** data. It allows users to analyze call data, device usage, and service performance over specific periods, providing insights such as busiest hours, total calls, and device breakdowns.

## Features

- **Call Analytics**: Analyze call volumes based on time (hourly, daily, weekly), group, and call direction (incoming, outgoing, missed).
- **Device Analytics**: Get a breakdown of various devices used for calls, such as Polycom, iPhone, Android, etc.
- **Service Analytics**: Understand feature usage by analyzing service-related data (e.g., feature names and event dates).

## Key Components

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Built using [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) for creating web-based interactive visualizations.
- **Graphs & Charts**: Visualize data using `plotly` with pie charts and area graphs.
- **Data Tables**: Explore data tables with call details, durations, and missed call information.
- **Filters**: Select time frames, groups, and report types (hourly, daily, weekly) to customize the analysis.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CDR-Analysis.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd CDR-Analysis
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare the dataset:**
   - Add the following datasets to the project directory:
     - `Call_data.csv`
     - `Service_data.csv`
     - `Device_data.csv`

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python CDR_Analysis.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the app is running, the dashboard will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` in your browser. Navigate through the tabs to analyze call, device, and service data, and use the dropdown menus to filter by dates, groups, and report types.

## Project Structure

- `CDR_Analysis.py`: Main script to load data, create UI, and run the Dash app.
- `Call_data.csv`: Contains call records with details such as date, group, call direction, and duration.
- `Service_data.csv`: Contains service usage data.
- `Device_data.csv`: Contains information about the devices used for calls.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- Dash
- Dash Bootstrap Components
- Plotly
- Webbrowser

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed service analytics.
- Integrate real-time data analysis and reporting.
